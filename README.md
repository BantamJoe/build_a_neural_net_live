# build_a_neural_net_live

##Overview
This is the LSTM neural net code for the Live [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoZU-ItDiE) session by @Sirajology. I'm using the TFLearn  library to train an LSTM neural network on a list of cities and then generate new city names.

##Installation


* tflearn (https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn)
* six
* ssl

use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install the dependencies

##Usage 

Run it like this in terminal, it'll take about 20 minutes to fully train


```
python lstm.py
```
